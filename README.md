- Display all available books
- Search for a book by ID
- Update book information
- Delete a book from the system
- File-based data storage

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- C++
- File Handling (using fstream)

## 📁 File Structure

- `main.cpp` – Core logic of the application
- `books.txt` – Stores all book records persistently

## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VineethaPadma/Book-shop-management-in-c-.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your C++ IDE or editor (like VS Code).
3. Compile the `main.cpp` file:
