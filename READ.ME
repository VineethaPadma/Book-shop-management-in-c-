Book Management System
This is a simple book management system built with React.js and Node.js. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. The system consists of a frontend developed with React.js for the user interface and a backend implemented with Node.js for handling data storage and retrieval.

Features
View a list of books with their details
Add a new book to the collection
Update existing book details
Delete a book from the collection
